		<P id="p">Toronto's famous landmark, the 553-meter CN Tower, 
		is one of the city's must see attractions and also the most impossible to miss. 
		Towering above the downtown, the structure can be seen from almost everywhere in the city. 
		Visitors have the option of simply appreciating the building from the ground, 
		or taking a trip up to one of the observation areas or restaurants for fabulous views of the city and Lake Ontario.</P>

		<h3 id="h3">Royal Ontario Museum!</h3>
		<p id="p">The Royal Ontario Museum, known as the ROM, 
		is one of Canada's premier museums with an international reputation for excellence. 
		It houses an outstanding collection and also features major exhibitions from around the world. 
		A controversial expansion of the facility saw a modern wing featuring glass 
		and sharp angles added on to a very traditional older building. 
		The museum contains collections covering a great variety of periods from all over the world.</p>

		<h3 id="h3">Casa Loma!</h3>
		<p id="p">Standing in beautifully kept grounds, 
		Casa Loma is an extraordinary building somewhat reminiscent of a medieval castle. 
		It was originally constructed for Sir Henry Pellatt, 
		an eccentric Canadian multi-millionaire who was among the first to recognize 
		and exploit the money-making potential of Niagara Falls. 
		With close to 100 rooms, including three dozen bathrooms, the house is now a museum.</p>
